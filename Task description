The input csv file contains the inputs required for performing synthesis using Yosys tool.
The csv file has Design name, output dir path to create the outputs, netlist path, late library path, early library path and constraints file.
The first subtask is to convert all the inputs into some format let's say format[1] which Yosys can understand and then also we need to conver the constraints csv file into SDC format let's say format[2] for Opentimer to understnad.
First we need to create a shell script where we pass the csv file which contains the required inputs and then call the tcl script to perform the synthesis/format conversion/run opentimer and then dump the required output.
Inside the shell script we should be checking for below scenarios.
Forst is whether the csv file is specified or not, which we call as argument.
Second is whether the provided csv file exists or not.
Third is to check if the user is trying to query the usage of the script.
